# HackGSU2018 - Statefarm Problem Statement

**_"Your challange is to develop an app that incorporate Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality to improve the customer experience in any of our product offerings. Alternatively, you could design something that helps promote State Farm Bank products. Use your creativity to tailor it to what you think may fit. Your theme can be fun, it can be applicable to real life, or whatever your team dreams up."_**

Our solution:

We created a mobile application using the Unity environment and the Vuforia plugin to develop a feature that will improve the customer experience during product offerings. The feature aims at increasing sales by carrying out two main tasks:

1. Present a real life scenario in which the customer could encounter an in-home risk by rendering the situation through Augmented Reality. 
2. Deliver an on screen detailed information about risk mitigation through Statefarm insurance policies.
